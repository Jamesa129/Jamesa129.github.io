Technologies: HTML5,CSS, JS , CANVAS , Functions, Event Listeners
 
Approach: I started with Canvas to get an understanding of what I was going to use, I watched several videos & rewatched them several more times for a better grasp. After I saw some progression with 1 Lane and a CAR "div" I worked towards CSS. I later scraped a lot of CSS and the div because I tried workarounds in positioning instead of using Flex. After I was confident with that progression, I went for 2 other roads and struggled more with CSS. after the position was set and done i copied my previous code to other lanes to replicate more Rocks. I made my player sprite seamless go into other canvases

Challenges: Collisions were a massive pain
Remaking css several times to fit on page how I wanted it. I went from grid to flex to transform. Hard coding different Lanes/Canvas instead of referencing
 
 
Wants:I wanted more responsiveness on the site. More buttons. More canvas.
Pause Menu. Reset
 
 Unsolved Problems: The first rock is the only rock that ends the game and has collision
